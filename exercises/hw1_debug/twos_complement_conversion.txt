Problem 5:

Assume that your computer uses 12-bits registers to represent numbers. If your computer can, what would be its 2â€™s complement binary representation for:

-13:
13 represeted not in 2s comp: 000000001101
                flip bits:  : 111111110010
                add 1:      : 111111110011  -------- answer


56:
56 represetned not in 2s comp: 000000111000 -----------answer 


-1: not as 2s comp:            000000000001 
                    flip bits: 111111111110
                    add 1      111111111111 ----------- answer


-2048: not as 2s comp ........ 100000000000
                        flip : 011111111111
                        add 1: 100000000000 ----------- answer


2048: Not able to. The limit for 12 bits is -2048-> 2047... 2^(12-1)-1
