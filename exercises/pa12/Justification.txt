The MyString class uses unique_ptr to handle the memory allocated for its member variable. 

The constructors properly initialize and allocate memory. 

The copy constructor makes a new memory allocation and copies the data from the source object.

The move constructor passes the memory ownership to the new object and ensures that the original object's data is cleaned up.

The destructor doesn't need to delete the memory because the unique_ptr does it when the object goes out of scope.

Using unique_ptr to handle the MyString objects in main ensures the allocated memory is cleaned up, making the code exception-safe and following RAII principles.
