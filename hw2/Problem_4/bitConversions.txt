a) Convert the hexadecimal number 3C2 to binary, octal and decimal representations. 

Hex:            3C2
// I used a hex to binary value table for each value
Binary:  3 = 0011
         C = 1100
         2 = 0010

         Combine them...
         Answer:            001111000010 (base 2)
        

Octoal: Get to binary: (from above) 001111000010
        Split up the terms: 001 = 1
                          : 111 = 7
                          : 000 = 0
                          : 010 = 2
                Combine them ...
        Answer:             1702 (base 8)

Decimal: 3 = 3*16^2 = 768
      c = 12*16^1   = 192
         2 = 2*1    =   2

b) Given two numbers in different formats (one is hex number 1A01 and second is a decimal 
number  8020),  what  would  be  the  best  way  to  compute  the  sum  and  product  to  get  the  
results in  hexadecimal format. Discuss your approach first then  perform the calculations 
and show your work. Notice that you can probably convert them to any format and then 
perform  the  computation  in  that  format.  Choose  the  approach  that  is  the  easiest  and  
doesnâ€™t require much effort. 

My approach would be to first convert the binary number to hex. Then add the two hex numbers in base 16.

Calculations:
8020 % 16 = 4               to hex: 4
8020/16 =501.25 (Use 501)

501 % 16 = = 5              to hex: 5
501/16 = 31.31 (use 31)

31 % 16 = 15                to hex: e
31/16 = 1.9 (USE 1)

1 %16 = 1                   to hex: 1
1/16 = 0

combine them (top number is 0th place, bottom is 3rd):   8020 -> 1E54 (base 16)

Additon in base 16:
carry:  1                   A + E = 15 + 2 -> carry 1; remainder is 8
        1A01
        1E54
